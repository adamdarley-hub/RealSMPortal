# FullStory Interference Fixes

## Issues Identified

The application was experiencing "Failed to fetch" errors caused by FullStory analytics service interfering with the native `fetch` API. This resulted in:

- `TypeError: Failed to fetch` errors
- Timeout errors from health checks
- Auto-sync failures
- Unable to load jobs data on production

## Root Cause

FullStory (analytics service) monkey-patches the `fetch` function, intercepting API calls and sometimes causing them to fail. The error stack trace showed:

```
at window.fetch (eval at messageHandler (https://edge.fullstory.com/s/fs.js:4:60118))
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Safe Fetch Utility (`client/utils/safeFetch.ts`)

Created a utility that:

- Tries native fetch first
- Falls back to XMLHttpRequest if fetch is intercepted
- Detects analytics interference
- Provides diagnostics for debugging

### 2. Updated Jobs Component (`client/pages/Jobs.tsx`)

- Added safe fetch implementation for all API calls
- Improved error handling with specific FullStory detection
- Added cached data fallback when network fails
- Enhanced loading messages for user experience
- Increased timeout from 5s to 15s to handle slow ServeManager responses

### 3. Updated Auto-Sync Hook (`client/hooks/use-auto-sync.ts`)

- Replaced all `fetch` calls with `safeFetch`
- Improved error handling for health checks
- Added fallback mechanisms for network failures
- Increased health check timeout to 10s

### 4. Error Recovery Component (`client/components/ErrorRecovery.tsx`)

Created reusable component for:

- Better error messaging
- Specific advice based on error type
- Retry functionality
- Offline/online status indication

## Performance Improvements

### Timeout Adjustments

- Frontend: 5s → 15s (to handle ServeManager processing time)
- Health checks: 5s → 10s
- Auto-sync: 60s → 30s

### Caching Improvements

- Cache duration: 30s → 2 minutes
- Better stale data handling
- Fallback to cached data on errors

### Auto-Sync Optimization

- Completely disabled auto-sync to prevent FullStory conflicts
- Reduced sync interval: 60s ��� 5 minutes when enabled
- Added circuit breaker pattern

## Network Error Handling

### Enhanced Error Messages

- FullStory interference: "Analytics interference detected - try refreshing"
- Network errors: "Network connectivity issue - check connection"
- Timeouts: "Request timed out - server may be busy"

### Fallback Strategy

1. Try native fetch
2. Fall back to XMLHttpRequest
3. Use cached data if available
4. Show helpful error message with recovery options

## Monitoring & Diagnostics

Added logging for:

- Fetch interference detection
- Network connectivity status
- Error type classification
- Fallback usage tracking

## Testing

The fixes handle these scenarios:

- ✅ FullStory monkey-patching fetch
- ✅ Network connectivity issues
- ✅ Server timeout (11+ second responses)
- ✅ Cached data fallback
- ✅ Error recovery with user guidance

## Deployment Notes

These fixes are particularly important for:

- Production environments with analytics
- Users with browser extensions
- Slow network connections
- ServeManager API delays

The application should now be resilient to analytics interference while maintaining performance and user experience.
