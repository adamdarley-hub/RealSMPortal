# Performance Optimizations

## Current Performance Issues Identified

### Backend Issues
1. **Background sync taking 21+ seconds** for 297 jobs
2. **Failed job change checks** consuming CPU resources
3. **Sync frequency too high** (every 15 minutes in production)
4. **No incremental sync** - always full refresh
5. **Large job objects** with all nested data being processed

### Frontend Issues
1. **No pagination optimization** - loading all jobs at once
2. **Heavy job detail transformations** in client
3. **No request caching** for repeated API calls
4. **Real-time updates** triggering unnecessary re-renders

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### Backend Optimizations

#### 1. Reduced Background Sync Frequency
- Changed from 15 minutes to 30 minutes in production
- Added smart sync based on data staleness

#### 2. Job Change Detection Optimization
- Disabled individual job change checks during sync
- Batch process job updates instead of individual checks

#### 3. Sync Performance Improvements
- Added pagination limits (100 jobs per page max)
- Reduced job object transformation overhead
- Implemented smarter conflict resolution

#### 4. Database Query Optimization
- Added proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- Optimized job listing queries with limits
- Reduced JSON parsing overhead

### Frontend Optimizations

#### 1. Pagination Implementation
- Default to 50 jobs per page instead of loading all 297
- Client-side pagination for better UX
- Lazy loading for job details

#### 2. API Response Optimization
- Reduced job object size in list views
- Only load full details when needed
- Implemented response compression

#### 3. Cache Optimization
- Added 5-minute caching for job data
- HTTP caching headers for static content
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data

#### 4. UI Performance
- Debounced search inputs
- Optimized table rendering
- Reduced re-renders with proper React optimization

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Full sync: 21+ seconds for 297 jobs
- Page load: 1.2+ seconds for 50 jobs
- Memory usage: High due to full object loading

### After Optimization  
- Full sync: <10 seconds target
- Page load: <500ms target
- Memory usage: 60% reduction target

## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables
- `BACKGROUND_SYNC_MINUTES=30` (increased from 15)
- `JOB_CHANGE_CHECK_ENABLED=false` (disabled during sync)
- `CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=5` (added response caching)

### Database Optimizations
- Added indexes on frequently queried columns
- Optimized JSON field parsing
- Reduced transaction overhead
